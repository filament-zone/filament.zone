Today marks an important step for Mekatek and Numia. We're introducing Filament, a project birthed from our experiences running growth campaigns for protocols. Filament is our attempt to bridge gaps, fostering protocol growth, engagement, and retention across the Interchain and beyond. By leveraging wallet activity for dynamic audience segmentation, we craft end-to-end campaigns that target effectively and ensure sustainable growth.

## The Growth conundrum for emerging protocols

As protocols set their sights on growth, they encounter a myriad of challenges. Traditional advertising platforms, fine-tuned for the Web2 realm, often find themselves at odds with the needs of the Web3 space. The disparities arise due to:

- **Privacy Dilemmas:** Mainstream advertising platforms tend to undermine user privacy, which is central to Web3's ethos.
- **Disconnection from Crypto:** Many of these platforms lack native crypto mechanisms, resulting in potential misalignments.
- **Centralization Woes:** Their predominantly centralized operations starkly conflict with the decentralization that Web3 champions.
- **A Lack of Cohesiveness:** Web3 isn't about bombarding platforms with disjointed promotions. We're in pursuit of cohesive solutions that complement rather than clutter.

## Filament’s Approach: Envisioning a Cohesive Interchain

With these challenges in mind, Filament is designed to support crypto projects in their growth and retention objectives. Our goal with Filament is to facilitate smooth interactions between campaigners with valuable messages and distributors with the right audience reach.

**Filament's Distinctive Features**

_Precision Targeting:_ Filament employs on-chain data, allowing for the creation of highly specific audience segments. This granularity enables campaigners to align their messages with users' actual behaviors, fostering genuine connections.

**Key Capabilities of Filament**

- **Experimentation Support:** Filament offers A/B testing, enabling campaigners to test various campaign elements and pinpoint what works best.
- **On-Chain Data Segmentation:** The platform's strength lies in its ability to segment audiences using on-chain data. This feature allows for crafting campaigns that truly resonate with specific user groups.
- **In-Depth Campaign Insights:** With Filament, campaigners can monitor the entire advertising journey, from initial exposure to conversion, providing a holistic view of campaign effectiveness.

## The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Filament

As of today, Filament operates as a fully permissioned system with whitelisted participants. Our focus on quality is paramount. However, we are in the process of establishing complete transparency and envision evolving into a privacy-preserving and decentralized system in the near future.

With the launch of Filament, we aim to further bridge the gap between crypto projects and their target audiences. The platform stands as a testament to our commitment to improving campaign efficiency and distributor reach in the crypto space. As we navigate this journey, we're eager to keep the community updated on our progress and innovations.

We warmly invite you to delve deeper into Filament, understanding its conceptual architecture and envisaged integration techniques. With Filament, we are at the commencement of a journey, one that beckons exploration and enlightenment. If our aspirations resonate with you and pique your interest, please do get in touch.
