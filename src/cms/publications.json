		"content": "2024 has yielded us ups and downs in airdrop-land. Let´s take this chance to reflect on what went well and what didn´t, and what we can learn for airdrop design in 2025 and beyond.\n\n## Airdrops vs. ICOs\n\nOverall, we are confident that airdrops will continue as a relevant part of TGEs and community and liquidity bootstrapping. While “ICO” platforms like Legion or Cobie´s Echo are on the rise, we do not consider them direct competition to launching via airdrops. Yet, it occasionally seems as if people are more willing to pay for tokens through an ICO than receive them for free through an airdrop - why is that?\n\n- (1) ICOs require participants to make much less assumptions. You pay amount X at Y FDV and receive Z amount of tokens. Vesting and lockup schedules are communicated before the purchase.\n- (2) Getting into an “early” private sale gives participants the feeling of being amongst the “insiders.” On the contrary, receiving an airdrop at TGE months after insiders have bought their allocations commonly makes participants perceive an adversarial insider vs. community relationship.\n- (3) Paying with money vs. paying with time pre-filters the type of community members willing to participate. You only buy into something you believe in. The incentive alignment is more straightforward than in many airdrop campaigns which have an implied conflict around who´s farming who.\n\nWhile there are clear advantages of ICO-type allocations, it becomes obvious that they only solve for financial commitment and project funding. Airdrops, on the other hand, focus more on community, liquidity, and activity bootstrapping.\n\n## 2024 - The Year of the Points Programs\n\nBefore airdrops became mainstream, the aforementioned functions of bootstrapping community, liquidity, and activity were mainly carried through liquidity incentives. Examples would be chain-wide programs like 2021´s [Polygon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZaMcMMSJwY) incentives and [Avalanche Rush](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/avalanche-foundation-announces-180m-defi-incentive-program-d320fdfafff7), or the plenty [proprietary DEX token](https://medium.com/osmosis-community-updates/osmosis-liquidity-mining-incentives-updates-from-the-lab-recap-april-06-2022-f136cedec87e) emissions for LPing that we have seen in the last cycle.\n\nThis year, points programs have emerged to fill the gap between one-off airdrops and regularly emitted liquidity incentives. Points aimed to bring forward two key value propositions - one for the users/farmers, and one for the projects.\n\n- Projects: Points programs over X timespan allowed projects to buy time for product testing and tweaking incentive schemes without incurring direct economic costs. Previously, liquidity incentives were set a priori to the completion of an action by users. Thus, if misallocated, projects faced a higher opportunity cost. With points, projects could monitor, analyze, and adjust user behavior on their chains and applications depending on how they set point distributions. No immediate payout post-action had to be made anymore.\n- Users: Before points, airdrop eligibility criteria were obscure and a game of best guesses or insider knowledge. Points (tracking) systems allowed users to reduce the uncertainty around (I) what gets rewarded, and (II) how it gets rewarded. Depending on the transparency of points programs, users had more or less assumptions to model out the projected ROI of farming a given project.\n\nWhile point programs provide clear advantages, they have come with new risks of opacity and expectation misalignments.\n\n- (1) Delayed TGEs and expanded “seasons” increased “who´s farming who” dynamics\n- (2) Too frequent adaptations and rule changes of point distributions led to frustration of earlier participants\n- (3) One-off airdrop returns were previously based on implicit entitlements, ICO terms (and to an extent, liquidity incentives) were based on explicit entitlements. Points programs are the weird middle child that does not fully fit either bucket, causing unmet expectations on both the user and project side.\n\nDespite these issues, points programs will prevail and offer advantages if a more granular and complex airdrop distribution is in projects´ best interests.\n\n## What types of airdrops are there?\n\nBefore we discuss what makes good and bad airdrop designs, we should better understand the types of airdrops we´re assessing. For now, we will focus on the stage of the project. One can also differentiate airdrops along other dimensions, e.g., niche-dApp to general purpose L1/L2.\n\n### Pre-Product Airdrops\n\n- **What**? New L1s, L2s, and dApps launching their chain along their token and airdrop fall into this category, e.g., Celestia or Dymension. In this category, it is hard to design the airdrop exceptionally well, but your risk of a “bad” airdrop is also low since there is typically little to no prior community investment (time or capital).\n- **Purpose of the airdrop**: You typically want to bootstrap liquidity, community, and activity  (governance & staking included) on your chain/application. Many projects in this category need to throw stuff at the wall and just see what sticks.\n- **Criteria and Distribution**: Criteria tend to center around retroactively rewarding interactions with aligned projects or underlying ecosystems. Depending on how “unexpected” the airdrop and the criteria are, it can make sense to implement flat, stepped, or other non-linear distributions.\n- **Risks**: If there is “nothing to do” on your chain or in your ecosystem, and if new launches and developments are not imminent, you run the risk of losing traction after a few weeks or months. The modular sector was a prime example for this dynamic in 2024.\n\n### Product, but pre-PMF Airdrops\n\n- **What**? You have a clear product vision, but your project is not yet known for a distinct purpose or usage. Often, you are trying to crystallize differentiators to competing ecosystems, chains, or dApps. Prominent examples of 2024 are Eigenlayer and the LRT ecosystem and new Eth L2s like zkSync or Scroll. Most projects of which you can farm their testnets also fall into this category.\n- **Purpose of the airdrop:** Given that you have an emerging ecosystem, you want to experiment around with which applications and use cases to incentivize. You have come far enough to direct incentives (through true/false criteria or points), but you are still too early to know if your incentives lead to the desired outcomes and should plan with lots of flexibility.\n- **Criteria and Distribution:** Integrating points programs often makes more sense than solely rewarding individual retroactive interactions. Depending on the extent of involving capital in farming the airdrop, metrics like median vs. average, and min. vs. max allocations become more relevant.\n- **Risks:** Be careful about implicit expectations from the community. Since there is ambiguity about what to farm, but there is a strong implicit expectation of reward, community members can feel\n\n### Post-PMF Airdrops\n\n- **What?** You have a live product (dApp or mainnet), you have a clear idea what distinguishes you from competing projects, and you have a solid user base. The most prominent example in 2024 was Hyperliquid with its $HYPE airdrop. Ethena´s $ENA was arguably right on the edge. There was a chance that users would abandon it post-TGE, but they have successfully proven sceptics otherwise.\n- **Purpose of the airdrop:** You want to reward your early and loyal users for past engagement and actions. Additionally, the airdrop can aide you to attract additional user inflow by gathering attention and gives you the chance to set the stage for future incentives.\n- **Criteria and Distribution:** You have a large dataset of past actions and behaviors, enabling you to carefully determine which of these you want to reward and how. You want to set criteria and distribution in a way that early users feel disproportionately and surprisingly rewarded for using a product that they would have ideally embraced without a token anyway.\n- **Risks:** In many cases, e.g., Aevo, you think you have PMF, but your community abandons you as soon as you launched your token. Pre-TGE, it is ambiguous whether you only have a great product, or if your project´s perception is distorted through implicit airdrop expectations.\n\n## What made good an bad airdrops in 2024?\n\nGiven the wide variety of projects that TGE´ed in 2024, we can extract a handful of observations and lessons.\n\n- (1) PMF matters. If your product is either bad or fails to distinguish itself from competitors in the long-run, you won´t be able to compensate for lacking PMF post-TGE. Hyperliquid is the best example. Since they are the first perp DEX that can actually match the UX of a CEX, their community has grown and flourished more than ever post-TGE. Ethena is a similar example. They used their season 1 to hyperscale and proved they had PMF right after. The product works and has provided users yields ever since.\n- (2) A good airdrop is like a tasteful skirt: Short enough to provoke excitement, long enough to leave enough room for imagination and speculation. If your airdrop is very predictable, you are running the risk of being farmed by the spreadsheet DeFi power users who will dump your token minutes post-TGE. On the other hand, if nobody knows about or anticipates your airdrop, you will leave lots of community growth and attention capture potential on the table. Great examples of the right mix between anticipation and surprise were \\$TIA in late 2023, and \\$JTO in early 2024. Both airdrops managed to kick off the modularity and Solana DeFi seasons, respectively.\n- (3) Communication matters. Disappointment is the result of unmet expectations. 2024 airdrop campaigns have shown repeatedly how mismanaged communication and project perceptions can hurt communities and token valuations. The most impactful example is EigenLayer's \\$EIGEN. While the project has one of the industry´s smartest teams and most ambitious visions, they did not succeed in overcoming the perceptions as an overly technical, nerdy, and ivory-tower project. The \\$EIGEN airdrop was not badly designed, but its perceptions were mixed and partly negative. Another example is the liquidity management platform Aperture ($APTR). They had a useful product and an engaged community. However, constantly changing airdrop criteria and poorly managed communications led to lots of frustration of their users.\n- (4) Market conditions matter - a lot. You can only speculate how many projects delayed their airdrops and TGEs in Q3 and Q4 due to uncertain market conditions and the US Presidential Election. No matter how good your PMF, no matter how loyal your community, you do not want to swim against the stream when overall sentiment is in the gutter. EigenLayer and some LRTs were negatively affected by this dynamic, similar for Scroll and zkSync. Again, Hyperliquid managed to launch in almost perfect conditions.\n\n## Some Systemic Issues and Questions\n\nIf you are planning to TGE and airdrop in 2025, here are some initial hints and questions you shoudl ask yourself. We will expand on many of these themes in our upcoming 2025 Airdrops Outlook article.\n\n- How far am I from PMF? As Ethena has shown successfully, you do not need a confirmed PMF pre-TGE. However, if there is a clear discrepancy between people using your product out of conviction vs. only trying to farm you, the chances are high that you will lose traction soon after TGE.\n- Should airdropped tokens trade freely, or should I implement lockups and vesting? While there is no one-fits-all answer, it appears to be favorable to let yeets yeet right at TGE. If you are optimizing for the long run, it may be preferable to launch at a lower FDV and allow free transactions rather than trying to artificially suppress sell pressure through vesting. For some projects, a no vesting tax may be warranted.\n- Should I conduct my airdrop as a one-off event, or should I distribute it over several seasons? The answer to this question depends on what project you are, which users you want to attract, and how far you are away from reaching PMF. If you are an LRT desperately waiting to secure other projects, it makes sense to not blow all your firepower at once, e.g., EtherFi. On the other hand, if you have had a long ongoing airdrop campaign, you want to create a wealth event that users notice and appreciate, e.g., Hyperliquid.\n- How does the “low float, high FDV” meta impact my airdrop? Again, there is no cookie-cutter answer. What float and FDV you should target depends on prior rounds, token allocations, airdrop size, and market conditions. Regardless, if you are perceived as a “VC coin” with a strong insider vs. community conflict of interest, the latter may abandon you faster than you imagine.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n2024 has blessed and cursed us with more airdrops than any year before. We strongly believe that airdrops will continue to play a major role in TGEs, token distributions, and community bootstrapping.\n\nThere will be enough room to experiment with new and established airdrop mechanics if overall market conditions allow it - which we are confident that they will. We are at the verge of finally onboarding a large number of users into our industry. Projects like pump. fun, Polymarket, Base, and Solana have proven that we are (almost) ready for adoption. Welcome to the greatest playground of wealth creation in this decade next to AI. Let´s play.\n",

		"content": "TL;DR: Filament introduces a novel approach to Sybil-resistant airdrops by leveraging the power of staked delegates incentivized by robust metrics. This system aggregates subjective judgments about user authenticity while incentivizing delegates based on objective economic metrics, creating a more adaptive, nuanced, and efficient mechanism for token distribution.\n\nAirdrops have become a cornerstone of token distribution strategies, but they're plagued by a persistent problem: the Sybils. At its core, Sybils are one entity masquerading as many, aiming to claim an outsized portion of tokens. Simple in concept, fiendishly difficult in practice.\n\n## I Know You Are But What Am I\n\n![image.png](/publications/addressing-sybils/sybils.png)\n\nConsider Alice, a power user who maintains separate wallets for DeFi, NFTs, and day-to-day transactions across multiple chains. From one angle, she looks like a Sybil. From another, she's the exact type of engaged user many projects want to reward.\n\nOr take Bob, who makes a single large trade on a DEX every month, versus Charlie, who makes daily micro-transactions. Who's more valuable to the ecosystem? Who's more likely to be a Sybil?\n\nThese aren't just theoretical questions. They represent real challenges that have led to an endless game of cat-and-mouse between airdrop designers and farmers.\n\n## Existing Solutions\n\nFaced with the Sybil challenge, many projects have turned to increasingly complex eligibility criteria and sophisticated detection mechanisms. Two recent high-profile airdrops - Wormhole's and EigenLayer's - illustrate both the ingenuity and challenges of these approaches.\n\n### Wormwhole\nWormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, implemented a [comprehensive airdrop strategy](https://wormhole.com/blog/from-eligibility-to-sybil-detection-a-deep-dive-into-wormholes-multichain) that included:\n\n- Ownership Graph Analysis: Constructing a map of wallet clusters to identify potential Sybils.\n- Source of Funds Analysis: Examining historical data to detect suspicious funding patterns.\n- Behavioral Clustering: Applying the Louvain Community Detection Algorithm to identify similar transaction patterns across wallets.\n- Transaction Spam Detection: Flagging rapid, identical transactions across multiple chains.\n\nWhile impressive in scope, Wormhole's approach faced [several challenges](https://unchainedcrypto.com/whats-going-on-with-wormholes-airdrop/):\n\n- **Complexity:** The multi-faceted system was resource-intensive and difficult to explain to users.\n- **False Positives:** Some legitimate users reported being excluded due to normal cross-chain activity being flagged as suspicious.\n- **Delays:** The intricate analysis led to a prolonged period between snapshot and distribution, causing community frustration.\n\n### EigenLayer\nEigenLayer, a restaking protocol, took a different tack with a tiered eligibility system:\n\n- On-chain Activity: Rewarding users based on their interactions with EigenLayer's smart contracts.\n- Community Engagement: Allocating tokens to active Discord members and contributors.\n- Ecosystem Participation: Including users of related protocols like Eigenpods.\n\nHowever, EigenLayer's airdrop also [encountered issues](https://unchainedcrypto.com/5-reasons-e-beggars-are-not-happy-with-eigenlayers-airdrop/):\n\n- Farming Vulnerability: The publicized criteria led to a surge in \"last-minute\" activity from potential airdrop farmers.\n- Community Discontent: Many long-term supporters felt under rewarded compared to recent, high-volume users.\n\nBoth projects employed advanced criteria for bootstrapping their initial token distribution and yet faced significant challenges. Wormhole's approach, while thorough, risked excluding legitimate users and created distribution delays. EigenLayer's criteria, although diverse, were still vulnerable to targeted farming and community backlash.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that deterministic solutions often fail to fully capture the complexities of user intent. The rigid application of opaque criteria with arbitrary thresholds will inevitably create edges that can be gamed or lead to false exclusions.\n\nMoreover, both airdrops faced a common criticism: the difficulty for average users to understand or predict their eligibility. The criteria involves arbitrary thresholds that determine who benefits and who doesn’t. This lack of transparency can lead to community frustration and reduced engagement - the opposite of how initial token distributions should work.\n\nThese cases underscore the need for a more transparent, diverse approach to Sybil resistance - one that can evolve with new attack vectors and capture the subjective nature of user activity. This is what Filament does.\n\n## How Filament Addresses Sybils\n\nFilament introduces a new feedback loop that rewards a decentralized set of agents called delegates to identify Sybils based their subjective perspective while being rewarded for objective results. These delegates, whether human or AI, operate with public (though pseudo-anonymous) identities. Their actions are fully transparent and visible to the community, ensuring accountability. Here’s how it works in detail:\n\n1. Define Objective Metric: Campaigners (people running airdrops), define a clear, measurable economic metric that’s hard to game (e.g., total fees generated over 30 days).\n2. Criteria: Delegates propose and vote on criteria for distributing tokens, weighted by their stake\n3. Distribution: Tokens are distributed to users based on the aggregated criteria from delegate votes.\n4. Measuring Impact: The system calculates each delegate's marginal contribution to the economic metric by comparing the outcome with and without their input.\n5. Commission: Delegates receive commissions proportional to their marginal contributions, incentivizing them to vote for criteria that genuinely improve the economic outcome.\n\n![programmable incentives.feedback.png](/publications/addressing-sybils/programmable_incentives.feedback.png)\n\nThe approach aligns the distribution of airdrops with metrics that are hard to game ensuring productive distribution and durable community formation.  The key is to find a balance between the subjective nature of sybils in permissionless systems and objective measure of productivity aligned with community goals.\n\n- Subjectivity: Delegates use their expertise to propose criteria which they deem as valuable with their own subjective view of what constitutes a sybil.\n- Objectivity: The mechanism rewards delegates based on the measurable economic impact of their decisions, not just their voting power or reputation. This objective measure is hard to game and thefore filters out sybils.\n\n### Benefits\nWhy is this approach powerful? Let's break it down:\n\n**Adaptability**: As new Sybil tactics emerge, delegates can quickly adjust their voting strategies without requiring protocol-level changes. The rewards ensure these adaptations are driven by real economic improvements.\n\n**Privacy-Preservation:** Delegates can use private data sets to inform decisions without exposing sensitive information. Different credential systems can be integrated without enforcing public unified identities. The mechanism focuses on outcomes, not the specific data used.\n\n**Scalability:** The delegate network can grow and specialize, potentially creating experts in Sybil detection for specific ecosystems or attack vectors. The rewards naturally allocate more influence to the most effective delegates.\n\n**Economic Alignment:** By tying rewards directly to economic outcomes, the system ensures that delegates are motivated to make decisions that genuinely benefit the ecosystem, not just maximize their short-term gains.\n\n### In Practice\nImagine a new DeFi protocol, $FOO, using Filament for their token distribution. They might have:\n\n- Delegates analyzing on-chain transaction patterns across multiple chains\n- Human delegates with expertise in social graph analysis\n- Specialized delegates focusing on specific ecosystems (e.g., Cosmos, Ethereum, Solana)\n\nEach delegate would propose and vote on distribution criteria. The mechanism would then reward delegates based on how their criteria contributed to increasing trading volume or liquidity in $FOO pools.\n\nFor example, if a delegate's proposed criteria led to a significant increase in genuine user activity and fees generated, they would receive a larger commission. Conversely, if their criteria allowed Sybils to claim tokens without contributing to economic activity, their reward would be minimal.\n\nThis creates a self-correcting system where the most effective Sybil-detection strategies naturally rise to the top, driven by real economic metrics rather than just stake or popularity.\n\n### Challenges\nThere are several challenges that come with this approach. Here is we are looking forward to covering in future blogposts\n\n**Defining Appropriate Economic Metrics:** Choosing the right economic metrics to drive the  rewards is crucial. These metrics must align with the long-term health of the ecosystem, not just short-term gains.\n\n**Governance Overhead:** Introducing a governance layer can create new challenges, including slowing down time-to-market. Filament addresses this with a novel voting approach that ensures swift conclusion of campaigns, which we'll detail in follow-up articles. \n\n**Data Integrity:** Malicious actors might attempt to manipulate the underlying data to inflate their contributions or undermine competitors.  Filament must hold data providers accountable for the accuracy of their measurements and have mechanisms in place to incentivize data providers participate in a way that aligns with the other participants.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nFilament's approach, enhanced by a reward mechanism, represents a significant evolution in token distribution strategies. By combining the nuanced judgments of diverse delegates with objective economic incentives, it creates a system that is both adaptable to new Sybil tactics and grounded in real-world impact.\n\nThis balanced approach to subjectivity and objectivity offers a promising path forward for fairer, more effective token distributions. As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, systems like Filament that capture collective intelligence while maintaining economic alignment will be crucial for sustainable growth and genuine community engagement.\n",

		"content": "Want to earn for helping crypto projects distribute tokens effectively? Filament’s delegate system might be your next move. Let’s break down how delegates shape token distributions and—more importantly—how they get paid for their work.\n\n## Being a Delegate\n\nAs a delegate, your job is to vote on how tokens should be distributed in airdrops (called “campaigns” in Filament). But here’s the key difference from other systems: you’re not just voting based on what feels right. Instead, you’re incentivized to vote for distribution criteria that will generate real economic value for the project running the campaign.\n\n### How Do Delegates Earn Commissions?\n\nAt its core, Filament rewards delegates who make valuable contributions to campaigns. The better your voting decisions lead to successful outcomes for the project, the more you earn. It’s not just about participating; it’s about making a positive impact.\n\nImagine you and other delegates are deciding on criteria for a token airdrop. The criteria could be things like transaction volume, consistency of activity, or other measures that indicate valuable engagement with the project.\n\nYour votes influence which criteria are prioritized. If the criteria you support lead to more genuine user engagement and economic value for the project, you’ll earn higher commissions.\n\n### The Incentive Structure\n\nFilament uses an incentive system that aligns your rewards with the success you help create. This means:\n\n1. **Effective Voting**: By voting for criteria that attract valuable users to the project, you contribute to its growth.\n2. **Earn More When You Contribute More**: Your commission increases when your input has a larger positive impact on the campaign’s success.\n3. **Shared Success**: As the project benefits from better user acquisition, more campaigns are likely to run, creating more opportunities for you to earn.\n\n### Why Alignment Matters\n\nThe beauty of this system is that it encourages delegates to think strategically about their votes. Since your earnings are tied to the campaign’s success, you have a vested interest in making choices that will genuinely benefit the project.\n\nBy consistently making smart voting decisions:\n\n- **You earn higher commissions** from current campaigns.\n- **More projects will want to run campaigns**, knowing they can rely on delegates to help them succeed.\n- **Your reputation grows**, potentially increasing your voting power as more people delegate to you.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nFilament’s delegate system turns token distribution from a simple giveaway into a strategic tool for driving real value. As a delegate, you’re rewarded not just for participating, but for making decisions that contribute to the project’s success.\n\nReady to put your token distribution ideas to the test? Your insights could lead to significant rewards.\n\n## The Technical Breakdown\n\nWhile the basic idea behind Filament’s delegate rewards is simple—vote well, earn more—the actual mechanics involve a sophisticated system known as the [Vickrey-Clarke-Groves](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_mechanism) (VCG) mechanism. Let’s delve into how delegates earn commissions through this method.\n\n### The Commission Formula\n\nThe commission for each delegate is calculated using this formula:\n\n$R_d = R_{\\text{median}} \\times M \\times \\frac{V_d}{V_{\\text{total}}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta V_{G_d}}{\\Delta V_{G_{\\text{max}}}}$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $R_d$ : Reward for delegate $d$\n- $R_{\\text{median}}$ : Median reward given to users in the distribution.\n- $M$: A base multiplier set by campaigner to scale rewards\n- $V_d$: Voting power of delegate $d$\n- $V_{\\text{total}}$: Total voting power in the system.\n- $\\Delta V_{G_d}$: Marginal contribution of delegate to the campaign’s objective.\n- $\\Delta V_{G_{\\text{max}}}$ : Highest marginal contribution among all delegates.\n\nThis formula ensures that the commission scales with both the size of the distribution ($R_{\\text{median}}$) and the delegate’s effectiveness ($\\Delta V_{G_d}$), while being weighted by their voting power ($V_d$).\n\n### Understanding Marginal Contribution\n\nThe marginal contribution measures how much value each delegate’s vote added to the campaign. It’s calculated as:\n\n$\\Delta V_{G_d} = V_G(w) - V_G(w_{-d})$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $V_G(w)$: Value generated using the final weighted criteria.\n- $V_G(w_{-d})$: Value that would have been generated without delegate ’s vote.\n- $w$: Weighted criteria vector after aggregating all votes.\n- $w_{-d}$: Weighted criteria vector excluding delegate ’s vote.\n\nThe weighted criteria vector is calculated as:\n\n$w = \\sum_{d \\in D} \\frac{V_d}{V_{\\text{total}}} \\times w_d$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $D$ : Set of all delegates.\n- $w_d$ : Delegate  $d$ ’s vote (a vector of weights for each criterion).\n\n### A Concrete Example\n\nConsider a campaign with two delegates:\n\n#### Delegate A\n- **Voting Power (** $V_A$ **)**: 60,000 (60% of total).\n- **Vote (** $w_A$ **)**: $[0.7, 0.3]$ (favoring transaction volume).\n\n#### Delegate B\n- **Voting Power (** $V_B$ **)**: 40,000 (40% of total).\n- **Vote (** $w_B$ **)**: $[0.3, 0.7]$ (favoring consistency of activity).\n\n### Calculating the Final Weighted Criteria\n\n$w = \\frac{60,000}{100,000} \\times [0.7, 0.3] + \\frac{40,000}{100,000} \\times [0.3, 0.7] \\\n= 0.6 \\times [0.7, 0.3] + 0.4 \\times [0.3, 0.7] \\\n= [0.54, 0.46]$\n\nLet’s assume this criteria leads to $V_G(w) = \\$2,000,000$ in transaction fees.\n\n### Without Delegate A\n\n- **Criteria Without A**: $w_{-A} = [0.3, 0.7]$\n- **Generated Value**: $V_G(w_{-A}) = \\$1,800,000$\n- **Marginal Contribution**:\n\n$\\Delta V_{G_A} = V_G(w) - V_G(w_{-A}) = \\$2,000,000 - \\$1,800,000 = \\$200,000$\n\n### Without Delegate B\n\n- **Criteria Without B**: $w_{-B} = [0.7, 0.3]$\n- **Generated Value**: $V_G(w_{-B}) = \\$1,900,000$\n- **Marginal Contribution**:\n\n$\\Delta V_{G_B} = V_G(w) - V_G(w_{-B}) =\\$2,000,000 - \\$1,900,000 = \\$100,000.$\n\n### Calculating the Commissions\n\nGiven:\n- $R_{\\text{median}}$ : 100 FILA\n- $M$: 3\n- $\\Delta V_{G_{\\text{max}}}$ : $200,000 (from Delegate A)\n\n**Delegate A’s Commission**:\n$R_A = 100 \\times 3 \\times \\frac{60,000}{100,000} \\times \\frac{\\$200,000}{\\$200,000} = 180 \\text{ FILA}$\n\n**Delegate B’s Commission**:\n$R_B = 100 \\times 3 \\times \\frac{40,000}{100,000} \\times \\frac{\\$100,000}{\\$200,000} = 60 \\text{ FILA}$\n\n### Alignment is Everything\n\nThis system creates a virtuous cycle:\n\n1. **Better Criteria Selection** → More economic value generated.\n2. **More Economic Value** → More projects want to run campaigns.\n3. **More Campaigns** → More commission opportunities for delegates.\n\nYour success as a delegate is directly tied to the success of the campaigns you help shape. By consistently voting for criteria that lead to valuable user acquisition, you’ll:\n\n- **Earn higher commissions** from current campaigns.\n- **Attract more projects** as word spreads about successful campaigns.\n- **Build a strong reputation**, attracting more delegation and increasing your voting power.\n\nReady to dive deeper into the mechanics or start participating as a delegate? The system is designed to reward those who contribute to meaningful growth. Your strategic decisions can make a significant difference—not just for your earnings, but for the success of the entire project.\n",

		"content": "\nToday marks an important step for [Mekatek](https://meka.tech/) and [Numia](https://www.numia.xyz/). We're introducing [Filament](https://twitter.com/filamentzone), a project birthed from our experience running growth campaigns for protocols. Filament is our attempt to bridge gaps, fostering protocol growth, engagement, and retention across the Interchain and beyond. By leveraging wallet activity for dynamic audience segmentation, we craft end-to-end campaigns that reach effectively and ensure sustainable growth.\n\n## The Growth Conundrum\n\nAs protocols set their sights on growth, they encounter a myriad of challenges. Traditional advertising platforms, fine-tuned for the Web2 realm, often find themselves at odds with the needs of the crypto space. The disparities arise due to:\n\n- **Privacy Dilemmas:** Mainstream advertising platforms tend to undermine user privacy, which is central to crypto's ethos.\n- **Centralization Woes:** Their predominantly centralized operations starkly conflict with the decentralization that crypto champions.\n- **A Lack of Cohesiveness:** crypto isn't about bombarding platforms with disjointed promotions. We're in pursuit of cohesive solutions that complement rather than clutter.\n\n## Filament's Approach\n\nWith these challenges in mind, Filament is designed to support crypto projects in their growth and retention objectives. Our goal with Filament is to facilitate smooth interactions between campaigners with valuable messages and distributors with the right audience.\n\n### Filament's Distinctive Features\n\n_Precision Segmentation:_ utilizing on-chain data, allows for the creation of highly specific audience segments. This granularity enables campaigners to align their messages with users' actual behaviors, fostering genuine connections.\n\n### Key Capabilities of Filament\n\n- **Experimentation Support:** Filament offers A/B testing, enabling campaigners to test various campaign elements and pinpoint what works best.\n- **In-Depth Campaign Insights:** Campaigners can monitor the entire advertising journey, from initial exposure to conversion, providing a holistic view of campaign effectiveness.\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nAs of today, Filament operates as a fully permissioned system with whitelisted participants. Our focus on quality is paramount. We're privileged to collaborate with some of the most innovative minds in the Interchain. The trust and involvement of [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/), [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/), [Sommelier](https://www.sommelier.finance/), [Levana](https://www.levana.finance/) and [Quasar](https://www.quasar.fi/) have been foundational to Filament’s early shape.\n\nAdditionally we are in the process of establishing complete transparency to evolve into a privacy-preserving and decentralized system in the near future.\n\nWith the launch of Filament, we aim to further bridge the gap between crypto projects and their audiences. The platform stands as a testament to our commitment to improving campaign efficiency and distributor reach in the crypto space. As we navigate this journey, we're eager to keep the community updated on our progress and innovations.\n\nWe warmly invite you to delve deeper into Filament, understanding its conceptual architecture and envisaged integration techniques. With Filament, we are at the beginning of a journey, one that invites exploration and enlightenment. If our aspirations resonate with you and pique your interest, please do get in touch.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: [https://x.com/filamentzone](https://x.com/filamentzone)\nContact us at: [connect@filament.zone](mailto:connect@filament.zone)\n",

		"content": "\n## Intro\n\nBlockchains are timestamping/ordering services first and foremost, that is, consensus on the content\nand the order of blobs of data. Tendermint does this for Cosmos SDK applications. The blobs of data\nare messages inside transactions inside blocks. The consensus layer has no understanding of the\napplication, ie it does not care about the meaning of the blob of data, and in most cases the\napplication is built without awareness of the consensus layer. This lack of awareness of abstraction\nlayers can be exploited for gain, which is quantified via MEV (maximum extractable value). The\nexistence of these different layers that are unaware of each other is not just constrained to single\nnetworks but also works between and across multiple sovereign zones. We believe that systems need to\nbe designed to minimize these mismatches and internalize them to be economically secure. Against\nthis backdrop we introduce Pulzaar, a blockspace coordinator for the interchain.\n\nPulzaar is an open auction house for Interchain block segments. It allows builders to efficiently\ncoordinate execution across multiple chains and offer their customers value add services with the\nsegments they bought, e.g. execution gurantees. Only they will be able to efficiently navigate the\nincreasingly complex landscape formed by a growing number of sovereign appchains and interaction\nbetween them.\n\nChains can sell continuous segments of blocks to maximize revenue while retaining the option to\ninclude their own transactions to not compromise on censorship risk. With the help of modules\ntargeting Cosmos SDK, CosmWasm and other execution environments any chain can opt-in to integrate\nwith Pulzaar and bring builders into the domain of governance.\n\nOur main objective is: **Make** **Pulzaar permissionless, efficient and aligned with the Cosmos\nvision of sovereign zones.**\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current state of the Cosmos ecosystem is complicated. Cosmos like most network suffers from the\nprincipal agent problem. Validators are selected by stakers to secure the network but have\n[monetary incentives](https://meka.tech/writing/analysing-the-atomic-arbitrage-space-in-osmosis-9fc75742-09e7-4352-8145-176ad47049cc)\nto maximize their individual revenue. Left unchecked, MEV extraction can grow to become a\ncentralizing force as a few large validators capture disproportionate value[^1] and offer outsized\nrewards to their stakers compared to smaller validators. With only large validators left, the dream\nof Cosmos as the community computer will die.\n\nThe problems stems from a few technical details within Tendermint/Cosmos SDK stack:\n\n**Temporal transaction ordering**: The ordering of transaction is not part of consensus, ie\nvalidators can order transactions as they please—though recently Cosmos SDK introduced a primitive\nfee market[^23] that hasn’t seen much adoption yet. But, a default Cosmos SDK app will order\ntransactions in a fifo manner. Although that ordering is considered to be fair by many, it comes\nwith a host of unwanted side-effects.\n\n1. For an open distributed system it is non-trivial to know which one of any two transactions\n   occurred first without having an explicit consensus instance for this problem and even then it is\n   a questionable endeavor[^11]\n2. If the ordering of transactions is not part of consensus then rational validators should sell\n   that right to the highest bidder off-chain making the fee, which makes the system less\n   transparent\n3. The absence of tools for agents to express execution preferences means that they will either try\n   to go with 2. or have to compete in latency games akin to HFT[^9]. These games pose a higher\n   barrier to entry (rent extraction of validators by selling colocation), are zero-sum and can also\n   negatively impact network health by causing congestion at times when blockspace is the most\n   valuable—e.g. during the Luna crash in May 2022 many people were unable to repay their loans\n   because blocks were congested by bots trying to arbitrage DEX pools and running\n   liquidations[^28].\n\nThese lead to an externalization of revenue and less community oversight due to off-chain\nagreements.\n\n**ABCI**: The Cosmos SDK is flexible enough to enable many applications that do not concern\nthemselves with consensus, but the recent past[^28] has shown us that ignoring the reality of how\nconsensus works has a very real influence on the security and viability of applications.\nUnfortunately the current pre 1.0 ABCI is not general enough to let applications hook into and\nchange how blocks are processed. That makes it impossible for the Cosmos SDK to have any insight on\nwhat happens on the consensus level without maintaining a fork of the Cosmos SDK.\n\nThe reoccurring theme is a lack of separation of concerns, which makes it hard to incentivize\nspecialized actors to compete in a manner that is not detrimental to the network. Along with the\nmissing open infrastructure for users to express execution preferences it leaves us in a suboptimal\nsituation.\n\nThis is especially pertinent to cross chain MEV which will most likely dwarf the MEV available on\nany single chain and present massive incentives for large validators who are active on many chains\nto capture this value. Without an open market, these validators will most likely favor bilateral\nagreements with other actors which are opaque and further entrench their power.\n\n## State of the solution space\n\nThe problems outlined in the previous section are not exclusive to the Interchain ecosystem and in\nthis section we want to give a non-exhaustive overview of other solutions before describing ours.\n\nResolving principal agent problems in the context of blockchains is generally done via two\napproaches, or a mix of them:\n\n1. Internalizing externalities and unbundling the power of the agent.\n2. Removing power and replacing it with randomness\n\nFor example, the ordering of transactions is currently not part of Tendermint consensus, which means\nthat validators can order them freely. With approach 1. validators might no longer build blocks but\nonly concern themselves with consensus and outsource the block building to specialized builders who\ncompete in an open market to produce optimal blocks.\n\nMost of the following techniques can be mixed and matched to produce systems that make different\nassumptions about execution guarantees.\n\n### Proposer-builder separation\n\n**mev-geth/mev-relay:** The Flash Boys 2.0 paper[^2] was the first comprehensive review of bot\nactivity in the Ethereum mempool. Bots were observed competing for opportunities via (priority) gas\nauctions (PGA), i.e. bidding via gas prices to be included before or after a target transaction\nbecause miners typically ordered transaction by gas price. By the end of 2020 the spam caused by\nthis behaviour had gotten so severe that a newly formed research collective named Flashbots\nintroduced mev-geth and mev-relay[^3]. mev-geth is a modified version of the geth software run by\nall miners which connects to the mev-relay. By running this patch miners allow outsiders to submit\nbundles of transactions via the mev-relay. The mev-relay runs a sealed bid auctions and only the\nwinning bundles of this auction lands on chain, reducing spam previously caused by searchers.\nAnother upside for searchers is the better execution guarantee because a bundle is only included if\nthe transactions contained succeed. The first bundle was included in a block on 2020-12-29[^4] and\nby 2021-05 more than 90% of Ethereum hash rate participated[^5]. Flashbots offered a crucial service\nin time of need but it is also important to mention that the system was fully based on trust and\nreputation and any organization with less integrity could’ve wrecked a lot of havoc. On the\nTendermint side, there are [Skip](https://github.com/skip-mev/mev-tendermint) and\n[Zenith](https://meka.tech/zenith) which offer similar services as flashbots do.\n\n**mev-boost**: While wildly successful, mev-geth/mev-relay was always intended to be a temporary\nsolution until an in-protocol mechanism is ready for production. With Ethereum’s transition from PoW\nto PoS mev-geth got an upgrade to mev-boost. Before, Flashbots acted as the single builder of blocks\nfor mev-geth operators. mev-boost[^6] allows validators (block proposers) to not just use Flashbots\nbut connect their node to many relays which aggregate many competing builders. mev-boost was made\npossible by collaboration of many Ethereum ecosystem participants who produced a unified interface\nfor block builders[^7]. This is still not an in-protocol solution but starts removing Flashbot from\nits privileged position as the sole block builder while the slower moving Ethereum base layer tries\nto land a protocol native solution.\n\n**PBS**: The proposer-builder-separation[8] design proposed by Vitalik Buterin as an in-protocol\nsolution is the foundation for most efforts in the Ethereum ecosystem with the goal to remove as\nmany trust assumptions as possible between proposer and builder to enable a more open market. For\nexample, with the current mev-relay block builders have to trust the relay to not steal their\nbundles, which would make that the establishment of some off-chain reputation registry for both\nproposers and builders very likely, in turn making the system less open.\n\nThese three systems represent one approach to dealing with execution guarantees/mev, that is, as\nsomething that needs to be internalized and made legible to the consensus system because it allows\nbetter alignment of incentives for all parties involved and reduces trust assumptions. There are\nteams working on similar systems for other blockchains[^10][^14]. This is the approach that we\nbelieve to be the best.\n\n### Fair sequencing\n\nAnother class of systems tries to focus on “fairness” achieved by establishing a canonical temporal\nordering for transactions, which is probably impossible in an open adversarial setting and none of\nthese systems have seen any open deployments to put these claims to test.\n\n**Bullshark/Tusk**: These rely on secure, reliable broadcast systems and their main insights is the\ndecoupling of mempool (dissemination of transactions) and consensus on just metadata to achieve high\nthroughput. To make the system work, transactions are placed into a DAG which can then be used to\nestablish a temporal order.\n\n**Chainlink FSS**: The Fair Sequencing Service[^12] that Chainlink wants to offer is based on the\nAequitas protocol[^11] and can best be described as an additional round of consensus on the order of\ntransactions observed by consensus nodes.\n\n### Cryptography\n\nNext, we consider cryptographic means, with the goal of preventing “bad” behaviour, eg front\nrunning, by hiding transaction content.\n\n**Threshold Encryption**: Using threshold encryption schemes for transactions or blocks is\nconceptually the same as commit-reveal schemes, though they differ in mechanics. Both achieve\nfrontrunning resistance in return for added latency. One recent example is Ferveo[^13], which\ndetails one such system and integrates it tightly into Tendermint consensus to end up with a fairly\nefficient system, that provides transaction hiding as long as 2/3 of the stake is not colluding,\nthough the system can not prove collusion.\n\n**SGX/TEE**: Secret network[^15] uses keys held inside trusted hardware to allow operations on\nencrypted transactions and state. A user encrypts their transaction to one of the keys held inside\nthe secure enclaves in theory protecting them from front running. Intel SGX or TEEs in general are\nvery enticing for protocol designers because if we assume trusted hardware exists, ie an execution\nenvironment that is opaque to the host machine, then many protocol designs can be much\nsimpler—unfortunately, it’s been a flawed assumption thus far[^27].\n\n### Auctions\n\nAll previous systems try to be generic to work with any application but applications can be designed\nin a way to minimize their externalities or internalize as much of it as possible.\n\n**PFOF**: Payment for order flow is one tool that can easily be adopted at an application level to\ninternalize some externalities. This should be of particular interest for appchains because they are\nalready running custom software that could easily be modified to include this functionality, e.g. on\nOsmosis automatic backrunning could be implemented that way. One live product with this focus is\nRook[^16].\n\n**Batch auctions**: The high frequency trading arms race observed since the early 2000s prompted\nBudish et al[^20] to suggest replacing the continuous order book with batch auctions to remove the\nnecessity for zero sum latency games. Batch auctions being a fit for blockchains with blocks being\nthe natural choice of batch was an early insight[^19] but the mechanism never really took off,\nalthough CowSwap seems to be gaining traction on EVM networks while Penumbra[^18] is going to launch\na zone utilizing batch auctions and cryptography to minimize front running.\n\n## Solution\n\nOver the course of 2022 we sketched out different designs for systems that would:\n\n- improve execution quality for users\n- better align incentives by properly attributing and sharing value created across involved parties\n- provide execution across multiple chains\n- be governable by participating chains or communities in general\n\nThe designs were informed by the realization that the commodity of execution is blockspace[^21] and\nthat many of the dynamics from other commodity markets apply, e.g. chains and builders will want to\nhedge via futures because commodities prices are typically very volatile. A related assumption is\nthat blockspace is abundant, which implies that itself is worth very little but execution guarantees\nare worth a lot, that is the privilege to change some state at a desired point in time.\n\nOur discussions with external stakeholders informed the formulation of the interchain scheduler[^26]\nwhile our internal discussions converged on similar concepts and we believe the idea provides a\nsolid foundation for what we need.\n\nThe service Pulzaar will provide is a market place for interchain block segments. Block segments are\ncontiguous blockspace which can be positioned reliably and verified on chain and provide a\ncensorship resistance stepping stone towards a scheduler for the interchain[^26] and ultimately\nbetter execution guarantees.\n\nThis market place should have the following high level properties:\n\n- opt-in: every chain can choose to participate\n- governable: if chains opt-in they have power over block space its validators sell\n- low implementation complexity\n- pre-confirmation privacy of bids\n- censorship resistance: it should be costly or even impossible for a builder to censor transactions\n- community owned and operated\n\nFor a functioning marketplace we need credible commitments[^25], be able to clearly identify the\nparties involved and facilitate payments between them.\n\nOn the supply side we have chains and delegators—who give validators/proposers the monopoly power to\nproduce block space—that want to sell continuous segments of blocks. On the demand side are block\nbuilders, who can buy these segments fill them with transactions.\n\nThe supply side, i.e. proposers, are already known entities for Tendermint/Cosmos SDK protocols.\nThey have explicit identities and duties enforced by the protocols for which they are typically\nenumerated. The goal is to make builders first class entities as well.\n\nOnce the market participants (proposer/builder) are legible we can introduce credible commitments\nfor both sides. Proposers, as representatives of the chains, commit to selling a segment at a given\nheight. Builders commit to paying for the segments they bid on. With these commitments payments can\nthen be facilitated or misbehaviour can be punished.\n\nTo get there we are going to produce:\n\n- **segment builder API specification**: open standard to be used for communication between builders\n  and proposers\n- **segment builder module**: allows validators to interact with builders, facilitates payments from\n  builders and govern builders\n- **auction module**: verify commitments to buy block segments, which can originate locally (builder\n  API) or remotely (Pulzaar) via IBC\n- **Pulzaar**: IBC connected Tendermint chain, that other chains use to auction off block segments\n  to builders, acting as a point of coordination to produce and enforce commitments\n\n## Trajectory - Escalating Odds\n\nFinally, we want to setup a trajectory for our work given our current understanding described in the\nprevious section.\n\nTo start out we are developing and operating a trusted block builder service, Zenith, for a few\nselected chains. This is the quickest way to provide value to validators and users, while minimizing\noutside dependencies on the Tendermint/Cosmos SDK code bases, which have a high bar for changes to\nensure quality and community alignment.\n\nOur goal is to offer protocol level integrations for a diverse set of Cosmos chains, but to do that\nwe need the applications to be aware of the consensus layer and modify the rules of block\nproduction. Unfortunalety ABCI is not powerful enough to offer that capability. We could maintain\nforks of Tendermint and the Comsos SDK allowing applications to have more control over the block\nbuilding process but that would come with many downsides and little upside. Instead we want to help\ngetting ABCI1.0[^17] deployed. ABCI1.0 was first proposed in early 2020 but has not made it into\nproduction by 2022-12. It extends ABCI to allow apps to hook into the lifecycle of block proposing,\ngiving us the flexibility we need. Celestia[^22] is one prominent system that also leans heavily on\nABCI1.0 and we want to help to finally get it into production.\n\nThe segment builder and auction modules can only be deployed once chains enable ABCI1.0 but we plan\non making them available as early as possible to give protocol developers plenty of time for\ncommunity feedback, integration and testing.\n\nTogether with the modules we will also be proposing an API specification for the communication\nbetween proposers and builders.\n\nPulzaar will be developed in parallel with all of the above as a series of public testnets and in\ncollaboration with stakeholders from different chains. The first two testnets will be dedicated to\nbasic functionality of the validator set and IBC interconectivity. Once these are working, we are\ngoing to be testing our auction mechanisms and pre-confirmation privacy protocols in an open\nsetting.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we outline some problems the Interchain ecosystem faces and what a market based\nsolution can look like.\n\nFuture works will formalize the specification of Pulzaar, research robust incentive mechanisms,\nproof systems and governance of these markets. Beyond that we want to extend Pulzaar to not just\nprovide a supply of blockspace to builders but also allow it to be an aggregator for user\npreferences, which in turn should enable better incentive alignment between all parties involved.\n\nIf those sound interesting and you want to collaborate, please reach out to\n[connect@pulzaar.zone](mailto:connect@pulzaar.zone).\n\n[^1]: [https://hackmd.io/@flashbots/mev-in-eth2#validator-reward-economics](https://hackmd.io/@flashbots/mev-in-eth2#validator-reward-economics)\n[^2]:\n    Daian, Philip, et al. \"Flash boys 2.0: Frontrunning, transaction reordering, and consensus\n    instability in decentralized exchanges.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.05234* (2019).\n\n[^3]: [https://ethresear.ch/t/flashbots-frontrunning-the-mev-crisis/8251](https://ethresear.ch/t/flashbots-frontrunning-the-mev-crisis/8251)\n[^4]: [https://medium.com/flashbots/flashbots-transparency-report-january-2021-922514de8b8a](https://medium.com/flashbots/flashbots-transparency-report-january-2021-922514de8b8a)\n[^5]:\n    Weintraub, Ben, et al. \"A Flash (bot) in the Pan: Measuring Maximal Extractable Value in Private\n    Pools.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.04185* (2022).\n\n[^6]: [https://boost.flashbots.net](https://boost.flashbots.net/)\n[^7]: [https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs)\n[^8]: [https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725](https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725)\n[^9]:\n    Budish, Eric, Robin S.

		"content": "## Introduction\n\nCrypto has revolutionized how communities organize by enabling anyone to issue a token. What once was the privilege of nation-states—launching a currency—has become as straightforward in the era of Web3 as deploying a website was in Web2. Standardized interfaces unlock DeFi infrastructure and new markets, making ownership a composable primitive. \nHowever, this newfound power is not without its challenges. Tokens represent a double-edged sword. While they foster economic freedom, they also expose communities to financial incentives that may undermine their core values. \n\nA token's value is inherently tied to the utility derived from a sustainable community. Distributing tokens, therefore, becomes a race to cultivate that community before the token's value goes to zero. There exists many methods of distributing tokens, but they all have problems.\n\n## The Problems\n\nBlock rewards have been an effective way to distribute tokens, with Bitcoin being a prime example. Bitcoin incentivizes network security by providing block rewards to actors who provide hashing power. Driven by concerns of wasted electricity, proof of stake has evolved to use economic stake as a proxy for hashing power. Proof of stake has become a popular alternative, providing a compelling mechanism for incentivizing stake to secure the network. \n\nHowever, it is hard to assess how much security is needed. Most protocols overpay for security while under allocating resources to new forms of productivity. Increasingly, these networks provide more than just stores of value and, therefore, need additional resources than just security.  \n\nBeyond securing the network, protocols have allocated a portion of their balance sheet to bootstrap initial demand. Airdrops [try to reward productive behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02752) while avoiding being [farmed](https://www.theblock.co/post/292502/layerzero-offers-sybil-farmers-chance-to-self-report-in-the-name-of-durability), but often without success. \n\nFarming is a professional activity and most protocols don’t stand a chance. Isolating productive behavior with limited data and minimal tooling against a highly incentivized adversary is a recipe for disaster. Additionally, whatever criteria are set will be the [source of contention](https://unchainedcrypto.com/5-reasons-e-beggars-are-not-happy-with-eigenlayers-airdrop/). Too broad, and the [airdrop fails to concentrate on real users](https://6thman.ventures/writing/airdrops-an-analysis-of-over-2000000-events/); too fine, and rewards become concentrated, failing to decentralize the network. Arbitrary criteria behind an opaque process create rifts within the community. When trust is broken, it’s very difficult to repair, regardless of the value of the product.\n\nPoints systems have emerged to enhance airdrops by offering much-needed flexibility. Points represent a loose social contract centrally issued with ambiguous conversion criteria. They can be adjusted as market conditions evolve without prematurely diluting the issuer. However, points don't confer ownership of the protocol. Recipients have no say in network development or the conversion of points to tokens. [They often fail to align expectations](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/09/eigenlayers-eigen-airdrop-might-signal-demise-of-once-popular-points/) between issuers and recipients. Without a mechanism to resolve disputes, points also struggle to align the community with how the token should be distributed.\n\nToken distribution methods have become more social over time. With this shift, It’s become increasingly difficult to build consensus around what constitutes productive behavior in the systems we are building.  For decentralized protocols to last, we must marry this social reality with technical innovation. \n\nThe goal of Filament is to help communities find a durable balance between financial incentives and community objectives.\n\n## Areas of Improvement\n\nWith the problem in mind, Filament aims to improve the toolchain for distributing tokens in the following ways: \n\n**Improved User Experience**: The user experience of airdrops should be as reliable as that of e-commerce, with standard flows that are well-audited and easily implemented. An SDK will provide primitives for white-label integrations. Retail users should be able to interact with new projects without fear of compromising their safety. \n\n**Improved Data Access**: Better ways of accessing historical data, easily composed with smart contracts. Filament will provide a DSL for seamless querying of multiple data sources. Targeting a larger set of actors, wallets, relayers, and AI agents should be easy.\n\n**Repeatability**: Campaigns should be easily tweaked and replicated, fostering innovation through open iteration and collective learning. Filament should provide an open platform for replicating successful solutions and discarding ineffective methods.\n\n**Programmable Emissions**: Emissions should be dynamic, tied to different vesting criteria, and aligned with community objectives. Issuers will be able to deploy a new set of primitives adhering to common interfaces to compose with existing infrastructure.\n\n**Governance**: Incentives should align between issuers and recipients, integrating various actors to form a consensus. Participants should have a say in token distribution and a reliable dispute resolution process.\n\n## How Filament Works\n\nFilament offers a new way of distributing tokens by coordinating a set of actors.\n\n**Campaigner:** Actors willing to put capital at risk instigate change in the form of a budget. Campaigners can be Foundations with significant allocations, DAOs with specific mandates, impatient investors, or even individuals who want to see a change realized. Campaigners are incentivized by the productivity generated by the campaign.\n\n**Participants:** Actors who perform some work incentivized by the campaign. Participants can be individuals or parts of the supply chain, such as wallets, relayers, or autonomous agents maximizing profits. What binds these groups together is their desire and ability to contribute to the campaign according to the set criteria. Participants are incentivized by their fair share of the budget.\n\n**Stakers:** Bonded actors who specialize in ratifying social consensus. Stakers should not only be aligned with the Campaigner and Participants but also with the system's long-term viability to execute campaigns reliably and successfully.\n\nFilament is launching a network comprised of the Filament Hub and outpost smart contracts. The Filament Hub will serve as coordination points for orchestrating incentive campaigns, witnessing interchain state transitions, and providing local records of incentivized behavior.\n\n**Playbooks**: The smart contract language of the Filament Hub. A declarative language, allowing builders to design incentives, combining on and off-chain data sources for defining value flow and distribution. Playbooks can be shared and provide templates that make functional airdrops easily repeatable.\n\n**Outposts**: These are Smart contracts deployed on various platforms that interact with the Filament Hub. They manage funds and provide the primitives for programmatic emissions.\n\nFilament will also provide APIs, dashboards, and SDKs to make designing, deploying, and analyzing campaigns intuitive.\n\n## Trajectory\n\nThe following section provides a trajectory toward a fully decentralized network operated by a permissionless set of actors. The network will use a native token to bootstrap participation and move towards a supply chain sustained by fees and commission. The roadmap will proceed in three stages: heat, ignition, and finally, combustion:\n\n### Heat\nEstablish the core protocol interfaces. The system will be restricted for both Campaigner and Stakers but will be open for Participants. Campaigners run campaigns in exchange for Filament Points which will be passed on to their users. Stakers will bootstrap governance in exchange for native incentives.\n\n### Ignition\nThe Mainnet will launch with stable interfaces that are ready to operate production interactions without significant trust assumptions. A native token will be issued and distributed to early contributors. Stakers will be subsidized with emissions.\n\n### Combustion\nA Fully operational system with permissionless Campaigners, Stakers, and Participants. Outposts will be deployed on multiple networks, providing access to larger campaign audiences. Campaigners will be able to elect alternative staking positions, such as LP token holders, to align campaign outcomes with more diverse sets of actors. The commission will be paid to Stakers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFilament has a vision for Web3, where communities are durable and thrive. Tokens offer immense potential but come with significant challenges. Bootstrapping a community with financial incentives is difficult, and existing tools are not able to solve the problem. \nAirdrops can work if we accept the reality that targeting productive behavior is a social process. Filament provides a new set of tools that make targeting easier and conflict resolution possible. Protocols can avoid community backlash and allocate their token supply with confidence by providing a process of ratifying social consensus. Ultimately, tokens should be distributed and communities should be decentralized to provide new forms of ownership. This is the purpose of Web3.\n",

		"content": "## What is the Filament Delegates Program?\n\nThe Delegates Program is a vital organ of the Filament Hub and responsible for voting on airdrop criteria and distribution proposals. Delegates are DeFi power users, KOLs, (semi-)professional airdrop farmers, researchers, builders, and investors. The program aims to connect relevant stakeholders in the airdrop ecosystem and facilitate straightforward expression of preferences for token incentive designs. \n\n## What problem are we trying to solve?\n\nEverybody is frustrated by the current airdrop meta. Users feel resentment against projects due to opaque eligibility criteria and lacking reward for their efforts and capital contributions, and projects feel farmed and abandoned by airdrop farmers. This dynamic results in drama and selling pressure of newly launched tokens. \n\nBy creating a governance committee within a framework of economic and reputation incentive mechanisms, we address the time preference and arbitrariness of airdrop campaigns. The Delegates Program connects all relevant stakeholders and enables them to influence airdrop criteria and distribution design together with the campaigner. \n\nCampaigners profit from community alignment and distributed responsibility, delegates are rewarded with fees and reputation gains, and $FILA delegators/stakers benefit from improved expression of community preferences and economic upside. \n\n## How does it work?\n\nCampaigners initiate a new campaign by putting up a bond and selecting and evicting delegates from the delegates pool. Selecting delegates happens based on matching the delegates´ competence and preferences of the campaigner. The campaigner must include a minimum amount of delegates, and every eviction is associated with an eviction fee. \n\nOnce the delegates have been selected, they will be added to a Telegram group for communication between delegates and the campaigner. \n\n## How, when, and why to vote?\n\nCampaigns last for one calendar week. During that week, selected delegates are required to vote on:\n\n- (1) airdrop criteria: Which actions should get rewarded?, and\n- (2) airdrop distribution: How should actions be rewarded?\n\nHowever, the Filament Delegates Program improves on conventional DAO governance processes. Instead of live-attendance drama, we are building the infrastructure for a turn-based game. Delegates can set overarching preferences and conditions of approval that automatically integrate into campaigns. \n\nConsequently, campaigners can get a feeling for delegates´ stances before creating a campaign and thus set campaign proposals to reach a consensus with most delegates. Delegates can assume a workload of 1-2 hours per campaign. \n\nTo account for the objectives the campaigner wants to optimize for, delegates can weigh criteria differently. This weighting is subjective, i.e., it is up to the delegates´ discretion to build an opinion which criteria align best with the campaigners objectives. \n\n## What makes a good delegate?\n\nDelegates are incentivized to maximize their financial and reputational upside. The amount of $FILA staked with them constitutes their voting power. Therefore, delegates are incentivized to represent the preferences of their community. \n\nOn the other hand, if delegates build a reputation for disproportionate demands from campaigners, they are more likely to get evicted from campaigns, resulting in no compensation. Stakers are incentivized to delegate $FILA to the delegates offering the highest staking rewards paid in proprietary campaigner tokens. Thus, delegates need to find a balance between community representation and productive dialogue with campaigners. \n\nDelegates will be rewarded based on how well their voting behavior aligns with the objectives set by the campaigner. To determine the compensation, we implement a [Vickrey-Clarke-Groves](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_mechanism) (VCG) mechanism (to be detailed in future post)*.* However, delegates will always receive a base compensation, unless clearly malicious voting behavior has been detected. Thus, participating in a campaign will be unambiguous +EV. \n\n## Why should I become a delegate?\n\nIf you are devoting mindshare to airdrop farming, criteria, and distribution, participating in the Filament Delegate Program is an easy way to capitalize on your competence beyond your own airdrop farming efforts. There are several ways you can profit from becoming a delegate: \n\n- (1) Reputational gain: Flawed airdrops are a concern for a wide spectrum of the crypto community. By being an active and vocal contributor to fixing token incentives, you can build a strong reputation and audience.\n- (2) Financial upside: If you are an early member of our Delegates Program, you will receive a $FILA allocation. Additionally, campaigners will pay delegates a fee in their proprietary token, which is calculated as a multiple of the median airdrop allocation. This fee will be distributed to delegates based on aligning with the campaigner´s objectives and their $FILA voting power, and a share of the fees will go to stakers. If a campaign fails or a campaigner abandons their campaign, the campaigner´s bond will get slashed, and delegates still receive compensation for their efforts.\n- (3) Advisorships: Helping new projects with one of their critical go-to-market initiatives is a great way to build long-term relations. If you have ambitions to serve projects of your interest niche as an advisor, engaging in the Filament Delegates Program might be one of the easiest and straightforward ways out there!\n\n## How can I become a delegate?\n\nDM us on Twitter or hit us up in our Telegram group. Provide a short intro of yourself, your engagement in airdrop campaigns, and why you would like to join us as a delegate. \nIf your profile is interesting, we will jump on a call to get to know you better and evaluate your fit. \nNo worries, you can stay anon and operate under a pseudonym!\n",
